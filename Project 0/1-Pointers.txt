Pointers in C
-------------

1) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *temp;
  strcpy(temp, argv[0]);
  return 0;
}

Why is the above code incorrect (i.e., likely to crash)?

Since the code has a temp pointer that is not pointed to any allocated space in memory, it is likely to crash at run time. 

2) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char temp[9];
  strcpy(temp, argv[0]);
  return 0;
}

A buffer overflow occurs when the program name is 9 characters long
(e.g., "12345.exe"). Why?

Since the size of char is one, you can only have char temp be from 0-9, 
and since the name is 9 characters long with the null element '\0' going into the 10th, 
it goes into the double digits which will cause a buffer overflow. 

3) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *buffer = "Hello";
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
  return 0;
}

Why does this program crash?

Since program is pointing buffer to a memory block "Hello", when "World" is copied to the buffer 
it'll give an invalid memory reference error.

4) Consider the following C snippet.
void myfunc()
{
  char b[100];
  char *buffer = &b[0];
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
}

Is this correct?  What's a simpler expression for &b[0]?

Yes. 

Simplier version:

void myfunc()
{
  char b[100];
  char *buffer = malloc(100);
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
}

5) Consider the following C program.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  printf("%s %s %s\n", *argv, (*(argv+1)) + 2, *(argv+2));
  return 0;
}

If this code is executed using the following line, what will be the output?
> program1 -n5 abc

program1 5abc

6) Consider the following C program.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
char *myfunc(char **argv)
{
  char buffer[100];
  strcpy(buffer, "hello");
  return buffer;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *s = myfunc(argv);
  printf("%s\n", s);
}

What's wrong with this?

Can't do char*s = myfunc(argv) as myfunc doesn't exist as a return function.
