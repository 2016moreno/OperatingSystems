Part Two: Fixing the Bugs
-------------------------

Understanding the code

  1) Explain why this program uses the exclamation operator with the
     strcmp() function.

     If the words match, then the false boolean is returned. 

  2) Explain why the 'LENGTH' macro returns the length of an array.
     Would it work with a pointer to a dynamically allocated array? (Hint:
     understand sizeof).

     sizeof() is a function that is used to calculate the size of its operand. So 
     sizeof(*s) is the length of the first element in the array in bytes, and since the 
     operation is (sizeof(s)/sizeof(*s)), it'll give back the number of elements in the array.

     and no.

Bug hunting

  3) Explain and fix the logical flow bug within the switch statement.
     (What happens when the -h option is used?)

     No break used in case h. 

  4) Explain and fix the argument parsing error. (Why is entrycount never
     zero?)

     entrycount is always incremented at least once by default. 

  5) Fix print_result() to print results correctly and in the same order
     as the words were specified on the command line.  Explain your solution.

     Added an <= to make sure that all arguments were being read. Used fprintf 
     and stdout to make sure that results were going to the right place.
